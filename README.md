# To-do-List
My project basically helps in maintaining a memory of all the tasks that an individual has to perform in a day.
It is a To Do List which helps in organizing the work for all day.
It uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript to get the job done.
The concept of local storage has been the backbone of the project.
